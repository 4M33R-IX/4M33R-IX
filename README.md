# Hey, I'm 4m33r-ix 👋

I'm getting into game hacking, mostly focusing on CS2 right now. I'm learning how to build external cheats using C++ (I'm at an intermediate level).

### ⏳ What I'm Up To
My current project is creating a multi-hack not just for CS2 but for other games too.

### 🛠️ Tools I Use
- **Visual Basic** - This is my go-to IDE.
- **Cheat Engine** - Less pain in the a$$.
- **ReClass** - Makes it easy to find entity list.
- **x64dbg** - IDK why i have it.
- **Ghidra** - BECAUSE IDA PRO IS 2000$.

### ⚙️ Languages I Use
- **C++** 🔵 - My main language for coding cheats.
- **Python** 🐍 - Mainly I use it for networking, scraping, and automation.
- **Assembly** 🤖 - Very little understanding.

### 🎯 My Goal
My goal is to make internal, external, and kernel-level Multi-cheat

I hope I'm not delusional and actually make it.
